Module: recommendation.py

This module provides a function to recommend an optimal solution set (guess) that, if tested,
is expected to eliminate the most possible solutions based on the provided scoring system.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. For a given guess (candidate solution set), simulate its feedback (score) against every possible solution.
2. Group the possible solutions by the score (number of matching answers).
3. The worst-case scenario for the guess is the largest group size (i.e. the maximum number of solutions remaining).
4. The number of solutions that would be eliminated in the worst-case is the total number of possibilities minus this maximum group size.
5. The recommended guess is the one with the maximum elimination (i.e. the smallest worst-case remaining count).

Note: In many puzzles, the candidate set used to choose the optimal guess is simply the list of all remaining possible solutions.
